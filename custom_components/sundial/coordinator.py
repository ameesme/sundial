"""The runtime manager for Sundial.

One :class:`SundialCoordinator` per integration instance owns everything that
needs Home Assistant: the periodic adaptation pass, applying values to lights
(including the IKEA-friendly split commands), the astral/timezone work behind
the sun snapshots, and manual-override tracking with auto-reset.

The pure brightness/color math lives in :mod:`engine`; this file only feeds it
Home Assistant data and acts on the result.
